  <p>Firstly, the research team would like to thank you for participating in this project.</p>

  <p>In this study, you answered whether you thought a series of statements were true or false and indicated your overall confidence in your performance. The aim of the study was to determine if a state of confidence can be induced by the frequency of corrections or affirmations a person receives, and if so, whether that state of confidence affects subsequent reasoning about statements. Prior research suggests that self-confidence plays a significant role in regulating decision-making. When people receive positive feedback or experience success, they may become more confident and less likely to engage in careful, reflective thinking about subsequent problems.</p>

  <p>To induce a state of confidence, it was necessary to withhold that the affirmations and corrections were determined by a predetermined percentage and were not directly related to the true or false status of each statement. This means that certain participants were corrected or affirmed a specific number of times, regardless of their actual responses, to create different levels of confidence. We understand this was misleading, and we apologize for any inconvenience or distress this method may have caused. It was essential to use this approach to avoid bias in your responses and to properly investigate how shifts in confidence influence reasoning.</p>

  <p>Because accuracy labels were deliberately manipulated to induce different levels of confidence, some statements may have been incorrectly labelled as true or false. It is important that you do not leave the study believing these inaccurately labelled statements. To address this, we are providing a fact-checking sheet that identifies each statement’s correct factual status. We strongly encourage you to review this sheet so you can clarify any misconceptions or uncertainties that may have arisen from the study’s feedback procedure.</p>
