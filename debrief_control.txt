  <p>Firstly, the research team would like to thank you for participating in this project.</p>

  <p>In this study, you answered whether you thought a series of statements were true or false and indicated your overall confidence in your performance. The aim of the study was to determine if a state of confidence can be induced by the frequency of corrections or affirmations a person receives, and if so, whether that state of confidence affects subsequent reasoning about statements. Prior research suggests that self-confidence plays a significant role in regulating decision-making. When people receive positive feedback or experience success, they may become more confident and less likely to engage in careful, reflective thinking about subsequent problems.</p>

  <p>For the <strong>control group</strong>, the task was completed in the second round exactly as it naturally occurs—that is, statements were refuted or affirmed according to their actual truth value, without any predetermined or manipulated distribution of feedback. This means that the feedback you received was based solely on the correct veracity of each statement. There was no intentional alteration to the feedback you saw, and thus no deliberate attempt was made to induce any level of confidence beyond what the true feedback would naturally produce.</p>

  <p>Because you received feedback based on the actual veracity of each statement, some statements may have been labelled as true or false in a manner that might seem unexpected if you were not fully certain of their factual status. To ensure clarity and help you verify the accuracy of each statement, we are providing a fact-checking sheet that clearly identifies each statement’s correct factual status. We strongly encourage you to review this sheet so that any misconceptions or uncertainties arising from the feedback procedure can be resolved.</p>
