  <h2>2. What is the purpose of this research?</h2>
  <p>Today’s news landscape exposes people to an ever-increasing volume of content within very short timeframes, especially on social media. Individuals therefore encounter political claims almost instantaneously and must rapidly judge reliability to avoid forming beliefs based on misinformation.</p>
  <p>The study aims to examine the speed and efficiency with which people evaluate political claims. Results will contribute to Fletcher Scott’s PhD in Psychology and are funded by the ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society.</p>
